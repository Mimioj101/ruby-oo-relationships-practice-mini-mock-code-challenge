Overall Assessment: 1.5/5

Additional Comments:

I can see pieces of a correct solution here but there are still a lot of things that need to be worked on. My challenge for you both would be to ask questions and be engaged during the review lecture. There will be a lot of opportunities to see how the code you wrote differs from the solution. You should be asking questions about why that is and taking notes. Even if you think you understand you should be making sure that you have the correct understanding by asking questions and articulating how you believe things are working so that we can correct any misconceptions you have. I should hear your voices a lot during lecture.

After lecture I would like for you both to come back to this and work on a new solution separately. Cody, you should fork this repo so that you have a copy of this current solution, and then you both should work individually to get this as close to the correct solution as possible.
